# StreamlineCloud development 

To create your own content for StreamlineCloud you just need to have basic Java and Minecraft development knowledge.\r

## The difference between extensions and plugins
Plugins are Minecraft plugins with StreamlineCloud features built-in. So you are working with a normal Minecraft plugin just with the StreamlineCloudMC-API implemented. Extensions are installed directly into StreamlineCloud and can integrate more deeply with the system. So you need to create your project as a StreamlineCloud extension

## Code documentation
For the most of our api code we write documentations. So if you don't understand a function you can take a look at our Javadoc. If you are using IntellijIDEA just select the function with your mouse cursor and press 'CTRL + Q' to show the documentation for this function. Or you can visit https:\/\/javadoc.streamlinecloud.net\/ for a full documentation.\r

We are excited to see your extensions and plugins!
